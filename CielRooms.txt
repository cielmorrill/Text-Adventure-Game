Crimped rock surrounds you from floor to ceiling.

Lava Cave tunnel
It's hard to see. The best you can do is feel your way forward.
It's cramped.

Torch Room
This room is lit by torches embedded on nearly every surface.
You decide should you ever meet the interior decorator, 
you'll inform them it's overkill.
SOUTH is a tight crevice in the wall.
You wonder how you managed to fit through in the first place.
-----
SOUTH: LavaRoom2

LavaRoom3
Lava Cave Tunnel (Continued)
You feel claustrophobic. 
Is now a bad time to feel claustrophobic?
-----
EAST: LavaRoom2
SOUTH: LavaRoom4

LavaRoom4
Lava Cave Main Chamber
It's uncomfortably hot. 
You're not sure whether it's courtesy of the torches
or something else. At the very least, you have room to breathe.
NORTH is the tunnel.
SOUTH is another chamber.
WEST is a door with a massive padlock.

Lava Cave Chamber 2
Either you're losing your mind, or something is making noises.
You make a mental note to enjoy cold weather.

This place looks like it could collapse at any second.
For your own safety, you refuse to progress.

WEST: LavaRoom5

LavaGrotto
Lava Cave Grotto
The air seems more fresh. There is a table and chairs.
It is very quiet.

EAST: LavaRoom4

IronRoom1
Waiting Room
There is a faded rug on the ground. This place may have looked nice, once.
Now everything is covered in dust.
There are stairs leading to a second story - but they're almost completely destroyed.
SOUTH is a hallway.
WEST is the main room.

Countertops, drawers, and dust.
There are no windows. It feels cold - lifeless.
The only way is back WEST.

Ruined Entertainment Room
Glass shards, everywhere. The carpet is torn to shreds.
No windows. Just overhead lights and splintered wood.

SOUTH: IronRoom3

VineRoom1
Overgrown Room
Moss and rock overlap. It's slightly humid.
And also difficult to discern a path forward.
NORTH?

The plant melds into the door. 
Somehow, it's sturdy enough to use as a handle.
However, you're faced with a solid wall to the SOUTH.
